        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <p>
          Wordle has taken the world by storm, captivating millions of players with its simple yet challenging gameplay. 
          While the rules are straightforward, mastering the game requires understanding letter patterns, frequency analysis, 
          and strategic thinking. This comprehensive guide will teach you advanced strategies that can significantly improve 
          your Wordle performance.
        </p>
        
        <div className="blog-highlight">
          <p><strong>Key Takeaway:</strong> Consistent Wordle success comes from understanding letter frequency, 
          position probability, and systematic elimination strategies.</p>

        <h2>Understanding Wordle Mechanics</h2>
        <p>
          Before diving into advanced strategies, it's crucial to understand the fundamental mechanics that govern Wordle. 
          The game uses a carefully curated word list, and understanding the patterns within this list can give you a 
          significant advantage.
        </p>

        <h3 id="letter-frequency">Letter Frequency Analysis</h3>
        <p>
          Not all letters are created equal in Wordle. Some letters appear far more frequently than others, and knowing 
          this distribution is key to making optimal guesses.
        </p>

        <div className="blog-info">
          <h4>Most Common Letters in Wordle Solutions:</h4>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Vowels:</strong> E (13%), A (9%), I (8%), O (7%), U (4%)</li>
            <li><strong>Consonants:</strong> R (9%), T (9%), L (7%), S (6%), N (6%)</li>
          </ul>
        </div>

        <p>
          This data suggests that starting words containing these high-frequency letters will give you the most 
          information about the target word. Words like "STARE," "SLATE," or "ADIEU" are excellent starting choices.
        </p>

        <h3 id="position-strategy">Position-Based Strategy</h3>
        <p>
          Beyond letter frequency, the position of letters matters significantly. Certain letters are more likely 
          to appear in specific positions within five-letter words.
        </p>

        <h3 id="pattern-recognition">Pattern Recognition</h3>
        <p>
          Experienced Wordle players develop an intuitive sense for common word patterns. This includes recognizing 
          frequent letter combinations and understanding how they typically appear in English words.
        </p>

        <div className="blog-tip">
          <h4>Common Letter Patterns to Remember:</h4>

        </div>

        <h3 id="elimination-method">Elimination Method</h3>
        <p>
          The systematic elimination method involves using your guesses strategically to eliminate as many letters 
          as possible while gathering maximum information about letter positions.
        </p>

        <ol>
          <li><strong>First Guess:</strong> Use a word with 5 different common letters</li>
          <li><strong>Second Guess:</strong> Incorporate any yellow letters in new positions</li>
          <li><strong>Third Guess:</strong> Focus on remaining possibilities with new letters</li>
          <li><strong>Fourth Guess:</strong> Should be your best educated guess</li>
        </ol>
